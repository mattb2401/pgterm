## Safety Prompt for UPDATE and DELETE Statements

Starting from this v1.2.5 version, **pgterm** detects `UPDATE` and `DELETE` SQL commands that **do not include a WHERE clause** and 
prompts you for confirmation before executing them. This safety feature helps prevent accidental data loss by making sure 
you explicitly approve potentially dangerous commands.

### How it works

When you run an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` without a `WHERE` clause, pgterm will show a warning and ask:
If you respond with **no** (or anything other than yes/y), the command will be cancelled, and your data remains safe.

### Example session

```sql
pgterm [postgres.test_schema]> update cars set brand = 'Toyota';
WARNING: Your UPDATE statement has NO WHERE clause.
Are you sure you want to continue? (yes/no): no
Safe choice. Query cancelled
````

## üì¶ Developer Notes

* Built with Go, Cobra CLI library, and `pgx` or `lib/pq` PostgreSQL driver.
* Query output formatted via `olekukonko/tablewriter`.
* Schema-specific rewriting uses `xwb1989/sqlparser` for robust SQL transformation.

## üß© Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to:

* Add more MySQL-style command mappings (e.g. `SHOW INDEXES`, `USER` commands)
* Improve REPL UX (history, auto-completion)
* Extend support for custom SQL parsing & CLI features
